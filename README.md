# Self-Driving Car AI with Machine Learning and Deep Q-Learning

Introduction:
Welcome to the Self-Driving Car AI project! This project aims to develop an autonomous driving system using machine learning techniques, specifically focusing on Deep Q-Learning. 
The project is implemented in Python and utilizes the Kivy (kvlang) framework for creating a graphical user interface to visualize the self-driving car's behavior.

# Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to train an AI model to navigate a simulated environment using a self-driving car. The AI agent learns to make driving decisions, such as acceleration, 
braking, and steering, through reinforcement learning. Deep Q-Learning is employed to train the agent's Q-network, enabling it to make optimal decisions based on the current state of the environment.

# The project consists of several key components:

Environment: A simulated driving environment with various road scenarios, obstacles, and challenges.

AI Agent: The self-driving car AI agent that learns to navigate the environment using Deep Q-Learning.

Q-Network: A neural network that approximates the Q-values for different actions in different states.

User Interface: A Kivy-based GUI that provides a visual representation of the environment and the car's actions.

# Technologies Used:

Python: The primary programming language for implementing the project.

Kivy (kvlang): A Python framework for developing multi-touch applications, used for creating the graphical user interface.
Machine Learning Libraries: Various Python libraries for machine learning, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, are used for implementing the Deep Q-Learning algorithm.

Reinforcement Learning: Concepts and techniques from reinforcement learning are employed to train the AI agent.

Neural Networks: Deep Q-Learning involves training a neural network to approximate Q-values.

# Usage
Once the project is up and running, the Kivy-based GUI will display the simulated driving environment and the actions taken by the self-driving car AI. You can observe how the AI agent 
learns to navigate the environment by making driving decisions based on the trained Q-network.

Use the GUI controls to interact with the simulation, pause/resume training, and view the AI agent's decision-making process.
The AI car model has a brain that can be saved and loaded and then trained on other environments like different locations and different circumstances. This saved brain can then be loaded in these environments and can be trained accordingly.
